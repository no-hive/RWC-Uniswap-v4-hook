**RWC – Real World Currencies Uniswap v4 Hook**

One of the main shifts in cryptocurrency finance is the institutionalization.
This hook is the experiment: __Is it possible to create on-chain DEX pool where 
all the exchanges between stablecoins of different currencies take place not 
at internal prices but at external quotes of these same fiat currencies?__ 

If such pools exsist, this will make Uniswap much more attractive place 
for traditional traders and also secure possible business operations 
where deviations of several hundredths of a percent from classic quotes 
can lead to large losses.
